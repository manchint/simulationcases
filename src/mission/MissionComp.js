                <p>In today’s healthcare education landscape, simulation has become a cornerstone of training. Whether you're guiding a medical student through their first code or helping a seasoned nurse refine critical decision-making, simulation empowers learning in a real-world way—without the real-world consequences.</p>
                <p className='text-center'>At Pulse Scenarios, we believe in the strength of shared knowledge.</p>
                <p>Our mission is simple, yet powerful:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li key="1">Curate a high-quality, diverse library of multidisciplinary simulation cases—from emergency medicine to rehabilitation and beyond.</li>
                    <li key="2">Align each case with clear, evidence-informed learning objectives for targeted, outcome-driven education.</li>
                    <li key="3">Connect a global community of educators through open access and collaborative learning.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whether you're launching a new curriculum, updating an established program, or just looking for fresh inspiration—Pulse Scenarios is your digital partner in simulation education. Think of it as a dynamic, living resource that grows with your needs.</p>
                <p>We welcome you to explore, adapt, and evolve these cases in your own teaching environments. Simulation isn’t static—and neither are we.</p>
                <p>Let’s raise the bar for healthcare education. Together. We’d love to hear from you—share your thoughts, questions, or feedback in the comments below.</p>
